# Second mini Project with React.js

`I'm Relexsun from FireFlies`

AnB's second mini project Weather app.

## A Message of Gratitude

I had encountered some issues that were beyond my understanding, but fortunately, there were people in ANB school who were willing to help me. Therefore, I'd like to express my deepest gratitude to brother TurLeng, brother Moonlight, brother KimSang and brother Vatana for their assistance. They dedicated their time to try and help me solve all the problems and even patiently explain it to me along the way. Without them I don't think I can finish this project on time.

What they helped me with :
- 5-days weather forecast
- git deploy

I'm incredibly grateful that ANB has provided me with such a caring and supportive community that I've learned so much from.
